# Facts
Prop Drilling sucks!

Managing distributed state sucks even more!

Redux fixes both of these.

# Agenda:
Starting with a simple app we are going to:
- Implement Redux using `redux` and `react-redux`
- Connect the Redux store to Redux DevTools
- Create selectors using `reselect`
- Implement thunks with `redux-thunk`
- Convert to `@reduxjs/toolkit`
- Create persistance middleware
